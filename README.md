# spotifyAIO
A useful tool for all of your spotify needs.


## USES

### Getting song reccomendations based on your music taste
You can get music recommendations based on your music taste with this tool. Using the spotify API, your top artists, trakcs, and genres will be seeded into the algorithm to give you song reccomendations. You can choose to add these songs to your listening queue on spotify, create a playlist of those songs on spotify, and even download them using pyTube. You can choose the time period of the artists, tracks, and genres sampled (short term = 4 weeks, medium term = 6 months, long term = all time), and even choose how broad the variety is by choosing how many factors are taken into consideration.

### Downloading your Spotify playlists, albums, and tracks
You can download playlists from your library onto your device, or find an album or a track to download instead.
